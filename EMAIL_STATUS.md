# ColdCopy Email Configuration Status

**Last Updated**: January 2, 2025

## Current Status
- **Email Service**: Supabase built-in email (temporary)
- **Limitation**: 3 emails per hour (free tier limit)
- **AWS SES**: Production access requested, pending approval

## Timeline
- **January 2, 2025**: Submitted detailed request to AWS for SES production access
- **Expected Approval**: January 3-4, 2025 (24-48 hours)
- **Current Workaround**: Using Supabase's email service

## What's Working
✅ User signup flow  
✅ Email verification links  
✅ Auto-login after verification (no more login page!)  
✅ Professional landing page  
✅ All platform features  

## What's Limited
⚠️ Only 3 verification emails per hour  
⚠️ Emails come from Supabase, not coldcopy.cc  
⚠️ May go to spam (check spam folder)  

## Next Steps (After AWS Approval)

### 1. Create SMTP Credentials
```
1. Go to: https://console.aws.amazon.com/ses/home?region=us-east-1#smtp-settings:
2. Click "Create SMTP credentials"
3. Name: coldcopy-smtp-user
4. Save the credentials (you can't see them again!)
```

### 2. Configure Supabase
```
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/zicipvpablahehxstbfr/settings/auth
2. Enable "Custom SMTP"
3. Enter:
   - Host: email-smtp.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
   - Port: 587
   - Username: [from step 1]
   - Password: [from step 1]
   - Sender email: info@coldcopy.cc
   - Sender name: ColdCopy
4. Save
```

### 3. Test
- Sign up with a new email
- Should receive professional email from info@coldcopy.cc
- No more rate limits!

## Benefits After Setup
✅ Unlimited verification emails  
✅ Professional sender (info@coldcopy.cc)  
✅ Better deliverability  
✅ Won't go to spam  
✅ Ready for scale  

## Testing Tips (Current State)
- Use jaspervanmoose@gmail.com (verified in SES)
- Check spam folder
- Wait 1 hour between tests if hitting limit
- Or use different email addresses

## Platform is READY!
Despite the email limit, the platform is fully functional and ready for users. The email configuration is the only remaining item before unlimited growth.
