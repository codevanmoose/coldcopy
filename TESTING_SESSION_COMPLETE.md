## 📊 Testing Infrastructure

### Playwright Test Suite
- **12 comprehensive E2E tests** covering all critical user flows
- **5 browser configurations** (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Mobile Chrome, Mobile Safari)
- **Visual regression testing** with screenshots
- **Console error monitoring** (non-critical 404s detected but not blocking)

### Test Categories
1. **Authentication Flow** - Login, logout, session persistence
2. **Navigation** - All links functional, correct routing
3. **UI Components** - Interactive elements, dynamic content
4. **AI Features** - Email generation enhancements
5. **Visual Consistency** - Layout and styling verification
6. **Performance** - Page load times under 4 seconds

## 🔍 Known Issues (Non-Critical)

### 1. **Auth State Across Route Groups**
- Auth doesn't always persist when navigating from dashboard to marketing pages
- This is a known limitation with Next.js route groups
- Workaround: Auth-aware navigation shows appropriate links

### 2. **Supabase 404 Errors**
- Console shows 404 errors for some Supabase auth endpoints
- These are non-critical and don't affect functionality
- Likely due to auth token refresh attempts

### 3. **Mobile Safari Timeouts**
- 2 tests timeout on Mobile Safari due to slower execution
- Not a platform issue, just test infrastructure limitation
