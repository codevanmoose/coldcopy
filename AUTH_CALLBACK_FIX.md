# Auth Callback Fix - Email Verification Flow

## Issue Fixed
Users were being asked to login again after clicking the email verification link because the `/auth/callback` route was missing.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created Auth Callback Route
Created `/apps/web/src/app/auth/callback/route.ts` that:
- Handles the OAuth code exchange from Supabase
- Exchanges the code for a session
- Automatically logs in the user
- Redirects to dashboard with a welcome parameter
- Handles errors gracefully

### 2. How It Works
1. User signs up → Supabase sends verification email
2. Email contains link to: `https://coldcopy.cc/auth/callback?code=xxx&type=email`
3. Our new callback route:
   - Exchanges the code for a session
   - Verifies the user is authenticated
   - Redirects to `/dashboard?welcome=true`
4. User is automatically logged in - no need to enter credentials again!

### 3. Supabase Configuration Required
Make sure your Supabase project has the correct redirect URL configured:

1. Go to Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → URL Configuration
2. Add to "Redirect URLs":
   - `https://coldcopy.cc/auth/callback`
   - `http://localhost:3000/auth/callback` (for local development)

### 4. Testing the Fix
1. Sign up with a new email
2. Check email for verification link
3. Click the link
4. Should be automatically logged in and redirected to dashboard

### 5. Environment Variables
Ensure `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` is set correctly:
- Production: `https://coldcopy.cc`
- Local: `http://localhost:3000`
