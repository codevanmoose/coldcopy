I've reached out a couple of times about helping {{company}} improve sales efficiency.

Since I haven't heard back, I'm assuming this isn't a priority right now. I'll close your file and won't reach out again.

If anything changes and you'd like to learn how we helped {{similar_company}} reduce their sales cycle by 32%, just let me know.

Best,

Following up on my previous note - I put together a quick case study showing exactly how we helped {{similar_company}} achieve:

üìä 312% increase in qualified leads
üí∞ 58% reduction in CAC
üöÄ 3.2x ROAS on paid channels

The PDF is attached, but here's the TL;DR: {{key_insight}}

Would you like to see how we could apply these strategies to {{company}}?

I have a few slots open next week: {{calendar_link}}

I'm the partnerships lead at ColdCopy, and I've been really impressed with what you've built at {{company}}.

I think there's a natural synergy between our platforms:
‚Ä¢ Your {{their_strength}} + our {{our_strength}}
‚Ä¢ Shared customer base in {{industry}}
‚Ä¢ Complementary use cases

We're looking to partner with best-in-class {{partner_type}} platforms, and {{company}} is at the top of our list.

Quick examples of what this could look like:
1. {{partnership_idea_1}}
2. {{partnership_idea_2}}
3. {{partnership_idea_3}}

Our current partners see an average of {{metric}} from the integration.

Worth exploring? I'd love to show you our partnership program and discuss how we can drive value for both our customer bases.
