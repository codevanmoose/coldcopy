## Next Steps for Continuation

When continuing development, the recommended next priorities are:

1. **Set up CI/CD Pipeline (Phase 5-10)** - Essential for automated deployment and quality gates
2. **Implement HubSpot Integration (Phase 4-3)** - High-value enterprise feature
3. **Database Optimization (Phase 3-4)** - Performance improvements for scale
4. **Admin Dashboard (Phase 5-3)** - Support and management tools

The application is now production-ready with comprehensive testing, billing, compliance, and enterprise features. The foundation is solid for rapid feature development and scaling.
