   - Monitor performance metrics
   - Check cron job executions

2. **Set up alerts**
   - Error rate spikes
   - Performance degradation
   - Failed cron jobs
   - High memory usage

3. **Document any issues**
   - Create GitHub issues
   - Update runbooks
   - Plan fixes

4. **Proceed to Phase 2**
   - Digital Ocean infrastructure
   - Redis cache setup
   - Background workers

## ðŸ”§ Rollback Procedure
