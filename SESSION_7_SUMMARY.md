## 🔴 Critical Issues Found During Testing

### 1. Lead Management Broken
- **Issue**: Cannot add leads - 405 Method Not Allowed error
- **Impact**: Blocks all lead-related features
- **Location**: /api/leads endpoint
- **Priority**: CRITICAL - Must fix first

### 2. Template Creation Fails
- **Issue**: Cannot create new email templates
- **Impact**: Blocks template and campaign features
- **Location**: Template creation UI
- **Priority**: HIGH

### 3. Campaign Creation Broken
- **Issue**: Campaign wizard fails to launch
- **Impact**: Cannot create or send campaigns
- **Location**: /campaigns/new
- **Priority**: HIGH

### 4. Session Persistence Issues
- **Issue**: Page refresh shows infinite loading
- **Impact**: Poor user experience
- **Browser**: All browsers affected
- **Priority**: MEDIUM

### 5. Mock Data on Dashboard
- **Issue**: Dashboard shows fake stats instead of real data
- **Impact**: Misleading information
- **Location**: Dashboard stats cards
- **Priority**: MEDIUM

## 📊 Testing Results Summary

From the User Stories Test:
- **Total Stories**: 87
- **Tested**: 37
- **Passed**: 8 (22%)
- **Failed**: 19 (51%)
- **Blocked**: 10 (27%)

### What's Working:
✅ Landing page and navigation
✅ Basic authentication (with issues)
✅ Dashboard loads (with mock data)
✅ Sidebar navigation
✅ Basic UI rendering

### What's Not Working:
❌ Core functionality (leads, templates, campaigns)
❌ Session persistence
❌ Real data connections
❌ Most API endpoints
❌ User workflows

## 🚀 Next Session Action Plan

### Priority 1: Fix Lead Creation (BLOCKING)
```javascript
// Check /api/leads route - likely missing POST handler
// Verify workspace_id is being passed
// Check Supabase RLS policies
```

### Priority 2: Fix Template Creation
```javascript
// Debug template creation form
// Check API endpoint
// Verify template storage in database
```

### Priority 3: Fix Campaign Creation
```javascript
// Debug campaign wizard
// Fix step navigation
// Connect to leads and templates
```

### Priority 4: Fix Session Persistence
```javascript
// Check auth state management
// Fix cookie/session handling
// Ensure proper hydration
```

### Priority 5: Connect Real Data
```javascript
// Replace mock data with Supabase queries
// Implement real-time updates
// Add proper loading states
```

## 📁 Files to Check Next Session

1. `/apps/web/src/app/api/leads/route.ts` - Fix 405 error
2. `/apps/web/src/app/(dashboard)/templates/new/page.tsx` - Fix template creation
3. `/apps/web/src/app/(dashboard)/campaigns/new/page.tsx` - Fix campaign wizard
4. `/apps/web/src/lib/supabase/server.ts` - Check session handling
5. `/apps/web/src/app/(dashboard)/dashboard/page.tsx` - Connect real data

## 🔧 Quick Fixes for Common Issues

### Lead Creation 405 Error:
```typescript
// Likely missing POST handler in route.ts
export async function POST(request: Request) {
  // Add lead creation logic
}
```

### Session Persistence:
```typescript
// Add to layout or middleware
const { data: { session } } = await supabase.auth.getSession()
if (!session) redirect('/login')
```

### Dashboard Real Data:
```typescript
// Replace mock data with:
const { data: stats } = await supabase
  .from('workspace_stats')
  .select('*')
  .single()
```

## 💡 Platform Status

### Infrastructure: 100% ✅
- All services configured
- Database ready
- Authentication working
- Deployment pipeline active

### Application: ~40% ⚠️
- Authentication works (with issues)
- Basic UI renders
- Core features broken
- Needs significant debugging

### Overall: 70% Ready
- Infrastructure perfect
- Application needs work
- Can be fixed in 1-2 sessions

## 🎯 Success Metrics for Next Session

1. [ ] Can create and save leads
2. [ ] Can create email templates
3. [ ] Can launch a campaign
4. [ ] Session persists on refresh
5. [ ] Dashboard shows real data

## 📝 Notes for Tomorrow

1. **Start with lead creation** - it's blocking everything else
2. **Check API routes** - many seem to be missing handlers
3. **Test incrementally** - fix one feature at a time
4. **Use the test guide** - follow user stories for validation
5. **Consider demo data** - might help with testing

---

**Bottom Line**: Infrastructure is 100% ready, but the application layer needs debugging. The platform is very close - just needs core features fixed. With focused effort, we can have it fully functional in the next session.

**Estimated Time to Full Functionality**: 4-6 hours of debugging
