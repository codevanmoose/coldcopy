## Hunter Comments

### Comment 1 - Founder Story
```
Hey Product Hunt! üëã

Founder here. I built ColdCopy after spending years watching sales teams waste hours writing emails that get ignored.

The turning point came when I realized: AI can now write better cold emails than most humans - if you give it the right context and training.

That's why we integrated both GPT-4 AND Claude. Different prospects respond to different styles, and having both gives you the best of both worlds.

Happy to answer any questions! And if you're doing cold outreach, I'd love to hear about your biggest challenges.
