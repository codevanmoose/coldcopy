Until SES production access is approved:

✅ **Webhooks**: Event processing for bounces/complaints
✅ **Domain Verification**: coldcopy.cc verified in SES

## Monitoring Email Performance

Once in production:
1. Check SES dashboard for sending statistics
2. Monitor bounce and complaint rates (must stay below 5% and 0.1%)
3. Use CloudWatch for detailed metrics
4. Set up SNS notifications for issues

## Cost Estimates

- **SES Pricing**: $0.10 per 1,000 emails
- **10,000 emails/month**: $1.00
- **50,000 emails/month**: $5.00
- **Additional costs**: Data transfer (minimal)
