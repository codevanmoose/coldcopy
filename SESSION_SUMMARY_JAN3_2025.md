     - Black background with gradient blur effects
     - Light/extralight font weights
     - Indigo and purple accent colors
   - Three pricing tiers: Starter ($29), Professional ($99), Enterprise ($299)
   - Monthly/yearly toggle with 20% discount

2. **Build Error Resolution**
   - Fixed duplicate pricing page conflict (removed `/app/pricing/page.tsx`)

   - Successfully deployed after fixing path conflicts

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Files Modified
- `/src/app/page.tsx` - Landing page updates

const avgROIImprovement = ((replyRateImprovement + openRateImprovement) / 2) * 100
```

```css
/* Gradient animation keyframes */
@keyframes gradient-shift {
  0% { background-position: 0% 50%; }
  50% { background-position: 100% 50%; }
  100% { background-position: 0% 50%; }
}
```
